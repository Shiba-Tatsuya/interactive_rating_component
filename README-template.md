## Overview
An interactive rating component is a user interface element that allows users to rate a product or service on a numerical or star-based scale. It is commonly used on websites and mobile applications to gather feedback from users about their experience with a particular product or service.

Interactive rating components typically display a set of stars or other icons that represent different rating levels, such as 1 to 5 stars. Users can click or tap on a rating level to indicate their level of satisfaction with the product or service, and their selection is usually highlighted or animated to provide visual feedback

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
